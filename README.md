-The theme was to build a website which by default shows several tourist spots from South East Asia. 
-Successful registration allows users to add their own personalized tourist spots into database. 
-From "My List" section, registered users can see their tourist-spot collections and remove or update them as well. 
-These data get stored directly into MongoDB database. 
-From "All Tourist Spots" anyone visiting the website can see these data added by registered users, sorted into an ascending 'average cost per day' order. 
-The users can register through google/github authentication method. Also manual email/password registration is also available.

The project was designed and build from scratch. It took me roughly 4 days. I have used 
-React.js, 
-Express.js, 
-MongoDB, 
-Firebase, 
-Tailwind etc. 
Also various npm packages like swipper, reactMarqueTool, reactReveal, reactTypewriter, animate etc. were used to bring this project into life."Wonder Seeker" was an assignment project given by Programming Hero web Development instructor.
